# tech.ds
DoSomething.org's Data, Design and Engineering blog is called tech.ds and can be found at [tech.dosomething.org](http://tech.dosomething.org/).

The blog is built with a simple continuous integration system powered by Wercker that automatically updates a CSS file hosted with Amazon S3 whenever a commit is pushed to `master`. In the repository you'll find a simple task runner, some SCSS files that provide basic styles and import Do Something's [Pattern Library](https://github.com/dosomething/ds-neue/) and the compiled CSS.

tech.ds is built on Tumblr.
